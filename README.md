# unitscan - WoW 1.12 addOn 

![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/d7TLkZm.png)

This addOn automatically scans for any targetable units of your choice by name and alerts you upon finding one. Instead of the modern scanning methods which don't work for Vanilla it uses the API function *TargetByName* which was removed with TBC.

The alert is visually and acoustically an exact copy of the famous addOn *_NPCScan* which first appeared during WotLK.

There are two commands:<br/>
**/unitscan** lists the active scan targets<br/>
**/unitscan name** adds/removes **name** to/from the scan targets<br/>
added /unitscan help and /unitscan ?<br/>
added /unitscan interval #           (can change in-game searching seconds)<br/>
When a target is detected it is no longer removed useful for scarey patrols that sneak up on you!<br/>
and this adddon is still usable by hunters for rare spawns I am just adding more use to it for other classes!
