WoW Dir \Interface\AddOns\unitscan<br/>
This addOn automatically scans for any targetable units of your choice by name and alerts you upon finding one.<br/>
Instead of the modern scanning methods which don't work for Vanilla it uses the API function *TargetByName* which was removed with TBC.
<br/>
The alert is visually and acoustically an exact copy of the famous addOn *_NPCScan* which first appeared during WotLK.<br/>

There are 4* commands:<br/>
**/unitscan** lists the active scan targets<br/>
**/unitscan name** adds/removes **name** to/from the scan targets<br/>
added /unitscan help and /unitscan ?<br/>
added /unitscan interval #           (can change in-game searching seconds)<br/>
When a target is detected it is no longer removed useful for scarey patrols that sneak up on you!<br/>
and this adddon is still usable by hunters for rare spawns I am just adding more use to it for other classes!
